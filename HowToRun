How to run and configure the app on your machine
All dependencies are already installed in .venv.
a) Activate the virtual environment
In PowerShell:
cd "C:\Users\HariharanRajan\OneDrive - APG eCommerce\Desktop\RAG\Ranking model".\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
You should see (.venv) at the start of your prompt.
b) Run migrations (already run once, safe to rerun)
python manage.py migrate
c) Create a superuser (admin account)
Because this is interactive, you need to run this yourself:
python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts:
Enter a username (e.g. admin)
Email (optional)
Password (twice)
d) Start the development server
python manage.py
Then open a browser and go to:
Admin: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
User login: http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/
Main app (after login): http://127.0.0.1:8000/
6. How to configure stages and tasks (admin flow)
Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and login with your superuser.
Under Core you’ll see:
Stages
Tasks
Task rankings
Configure stages:
Click Stages → Add:
Set Name for each stage (e.g. Stage 1, Stage 2, etc.).
Set Description and optional Image URL.
Set Order (1–10) to control how they appear.
Once you’ve added 10 stages, they’ll show on the landing page as cards.
Configure tasks for a stage:
Click Tasks → Add:
Choose Stage (e.g. Stage 1).
Set Name and Description.
Set Order (1..N).
Set Is active = checked.
Add as many tasks as you want per stage.
To change the number of tasks available for ranking:
Either add/remove tasks for that stage, or set is_active to False for tasks you want to hide.
The app automatically uses the number of active tasks as N, so rankings go from 1..N.
7. How the ranking behaves
When a user opens a stage page:
They see all active tasks for that stage.
Each task has a dropdown with values 1..N (where N is the count of active tasks).
When they submit:
The system validates:
Every task has a rank.
No two tasks share the same rank.
If validation fails, errors are shown above the table.
If it passes, entries are saved to TaskRanking for that user + stage + task.
If the user comes back later:
Their previously saved ranks are loaded and pre-selected in the dropdowns.
8. Next steps / customizations
If you’d like, I can:
Add a separate, friendlier “business admin” UI (not just Django admin) for managing stages and tasks.
Add per-stage limits (e.g. max 10 tasks enforced).
Add chart/summary views of rankings across users.
If you tell me any extra rules (e.g. different ranking modes, multiple rounds per stage), I can extend the code accordingly.
